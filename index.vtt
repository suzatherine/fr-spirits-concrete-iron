00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:10.295
[audio playing...]

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.335
Let me introduce you to Clark, my city.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960
It's eclectic. Just like Liverpool. It's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.120
a center for culture, science,

00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:24.875
education, philosophy and trade.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.730
mysteries are full of students from

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.195
around the world.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.710
Today that between Asia and Europe, you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.650
can see our transnational history carved

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.040
out in the different architecture. Here

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.590
is where the first concrete skyscraper

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.710
was built in Soviet Union, and amazing

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.290
monument of constructivism, made from

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.435
concrete and iron using horses.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.520
Harkey is only 40 kilometers from Russia

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.555
and has become a city on the front line.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.710
From the first days are busy streets

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.080
with targets with rockets, classement

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.795
air bombs.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.040
But just like concrete and iron are hard

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.380
to destroy. Our spirits are also

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.930
unbreakable. As each of us bravely

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.205
questions our responsibility, asking,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.255
How can I help to win to survive.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.460
And for a moment, concerts were silent

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.590
and Philharmonic music close close the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.040
doors as musicians, like stars couldn't

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.290
have put down the instruments and became

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:38.795
a frontline volunteer.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.980
I was meant to play a concert in London

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.545
on the 28th of February.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.750
On the morning of 24th, a friend of mine

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.480
came knocking on my door shouting, wake

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.325
up, or you will sleep through the war.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.020
For the next few days, myself and other

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.270
artists gathered in a small flat near

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.015
the center.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.950
People were coming and going and we were

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.010
trying to work out should we stay? Or

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.174
should we leave.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.019
I received a phone call from a friend in

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.389
the more dangerous district saying that

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.444
there was a basement with 450 people

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.014
that they didn't have anything. No food,

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.189
no water. And it's too dangerous to go

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.514
outside. It was the moment I realized

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.119
that I must say that there was a

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.429
responsibility to provide and seek

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.609
resources. The flight I was in became

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.129
headquarters and everyone was an actor

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.639
or connected to music, art culture. It

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.254
was a little chaotic in the moment.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.439
Someone provides something and it's

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.769
distributed to anyone who needs sharing

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.769
everything. It was a very intense

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.729
process. After some time, it became more

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.619
organized. And we had districts and

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.949
volunteers in each area. Because it was

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.559
dangerous everywhere in Harkey was

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.409
dangerous. But I know a lot of examples

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.589
of bravery. And for me what I'm doing is

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.185
not brave.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.340
It was stressful and frightening. It was

00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:19.955
a lot of things.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.680
Everything makes you cry. But inside you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.300
have this feeling that you are in the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.750
right place. You are part of something

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.660
bigger than yourself, that we are all

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.505
equal. All Connect.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.720
Everyone helps everyone. And it doesn't

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.390
matter who you were before. You could

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.790
have been a businessman with a Tesla car

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.905
or an artist drive something very shady.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.790
Even the Chief Commander of the Military

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.090
Base work without hierarchy. It was a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.280
horizontal connection. It was

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.950
solidarity. You call someone if you

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.165
needed something, and you solved it.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.745
It felt that 100 People were one

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.740
before the full scale invasion. I was

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.885
asking these questions. Who am I?

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.495
What am I?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:23.285
This situation gave me the answers

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.530
it feels like making music hasn't

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.235
mattered for a long time.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.330
A lot of musicians reject music right

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.015
now.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.860
To play you must be in the moment. Be

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.310
present. Connect to your emotions is

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.770
very stressful and painful. And when you

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.110
start to play, you feel your pain and it

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.180
comes in such a way that you stop and

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.995
think never again.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.085
We don't have the space to be emotional.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.620
So you go around in the circle and come

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.165
back to the idea that is not the time.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.970
Maybe later

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:28.412
